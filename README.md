## General Information
We have a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. We want to build a regression based machine learning model to predict the price of a given house. We also want to:
* Know which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.
* Know how well those variables describe the price of a house.
* Apply Ridge/Lasso regularization techinques to handle any overfitting in the model.


## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis


## Technologies Used
- Pandas - Version 1.3.4
- matplotlib - Version 3.4.3
- Seaborn - Version 0.11.2
- Numpy
- statsmodel
- sklearn


## Acknowledgements
- This project mainly applies the concepts of Linear/Polynamial Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regression concepts.
- The data dictionary provided by the client was used for understanding the data.
- Resources on the web were consumed to understand various aspects of model building.
- Various documentations were consumed for syntax help.
